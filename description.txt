Attempts to patch/edit Terraria's projectile limit so there can be more.
(Changes are to the references)
The mod has a config so you can change to limit to what you want (from 1001 to 99999) (you have to reload mods in order for the changes to take effect).
Read this: In case terraria crashes while it's loading mods, hold shift before/during mod loading for skipping, then disable this mod or delete the config file so next time it opens projectiles are set to 2000.
Doesn't have multiplayer compat.
Might not have compat with other mods cause the way they're coded.
Of course, you're going to have a lot of lag.
It's your fault if you overload your computer with the projectile ammount.

Changelog:
0.1 - Initial release.
0.1.1 - Update to tmodloader 0.11.6.2, recoded the patches and patched vanillaAI for projectiles and npcs.

Thanks to the people in the tmodloader discord server for helping with my stupid questions.
